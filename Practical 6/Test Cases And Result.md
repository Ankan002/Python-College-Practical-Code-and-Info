TEST CASE 1:

Enter the first number: 17

Enter the second integer: 22

The Temp method: 

A and B before the swapping are 17 and 22

A and B after the swapping are 22 and 17

The a,b=b,a method: 

A and B before the swapping are 17 and 22

A and B after the swapping are 22 and 17

TEST CASE 2:

Enter the first number: 97

Enter the second integer: 153

The Temp method: 

A and B before the swapping are 97 and 153

A and B after the swapping are 153 and 97

The a,b=b,a method: 

A and B before the swapping are 97 and 153

A and B after the swapping are 153 and 97

TEST CASE 3:

Enter the first number: -56

Enter the second integer: 90

The Temp method: 

A and B before the swapping are -56 and 90

A and B after the swapping are 90 and -56

The a,b=b,a method: 

A and B before the swapping are -56 and 90

A and B after the swapping are 90 and -56



CONCLUSION :

After going through all the test cases we can conclude that both the methods work the same...
